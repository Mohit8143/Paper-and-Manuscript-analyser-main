# Paper-and-Manuscript-analyser
A project using "Gemini pro vision" to analyze the Question papers and also the ancient Manuscripts

We made this in-order to provide  the learning accessibility to all the students , using our Questionpaper analyzer we can analyse the question paper and get to know about the topics present in the question paper as well as a breif explaination over , similar questions to practice , we can also get websitees to study and further topics for deeper learning

In case of Manuscript analyser we can input the old manuscripts and we can get the translation out easily

Both the applications have multilingual options ( Telugu , Hindi , English )

P.S :
Our Manuscript model has provided better outputs compared to Google Lens and Microsoft Bing Ai


I advice to create a environment before running the code , may be that would be helpful

# pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 (run this in terminal if error occurs at the googletrans part)
